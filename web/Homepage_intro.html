	<p>Hello! My name is Alec Baird, and I am a 24 year old senior majoring
   in Software Engineering. I have been married to my wife for over 2 years,
   and we are looking to move to a new area at the end of the summer. I currently
   am employed as a Software Developer for the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls,
   where I work as part of the Information Management team.
